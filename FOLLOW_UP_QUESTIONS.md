# Follow-up Questions

- Should draft essays be completely hidden in production, or should there be an authenticated preview flow?
- Do you want to allow raw HTML inside notes/essays, or keep it escaped for safety?
- Should the `/powerlifting` page stay hidden and `noindex`, or eventually become a public section?
- Are tag links meant to filter the `/writing` page, or should they link somewhere else?
