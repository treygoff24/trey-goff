## Current Context

# Interactive World - Build Context

**Last Updated**: Phase 16 - COMPLETE

## Protocol Reminder (Re-read on every phase start)

**The Loop**: IMPLEMENT → TYPECHECK → LINT → BUILD → TEST → REVIEW → FIX → REPEAT → COMMIT

**Cross-agent checkpoints (mandatory):**
- After drafting implementation plan → Codex reviews
- After completing each phase → Dual code review (subagent + Codex)
- Before declaring complete → Codex final cross-check
- Stuck in error loop (3+ attempts) → Call Codex for perspective

**How to call Codex:**
```bash
codex exec \
  --model gpt-5.2-codex \
  --config model_reasoning_effort="xhigh" \
  --yolo \
  "<YOUR_TASK_PROMPT>"
```

**Quality gates before review:**
```bash
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm build
```

If context feels stale, re-read `AUTONOMOUS_BUILD_CLAUDE_v2.md` and this file.

## What This Is

Interactive 3D "secret level" at `/interactive` - a mansion with rooms mapping to site content:
- **Library**: Blog posts and book reviews as physical books
- **Gym**: Powerlifting PRs as plates on a bar + plaques
- **Study**: Holographic 3D knowledge graph
- **Projects Room**: Museum-like exhibits for projects
- **Exterior**: Mountains, O'Neill cylinders, Goff Industries mech

## Build Context

**Type**: Feature addition
**Spec location**: `/treygoff-interactive-world-spec-v1.2.md`
**Plan location**: `/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Tech Stack

**Existing:**
- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS-first tokens

## Key Files

### Existing (to integrate with)
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with providers
- `/app/globals.css` - Tailwind v4 config and design tokens
- `/lib/fonts.ts` - Font configuration
- `/lib/utils.ts` - Shared utilities
- `/components/ui/StarfieldBackground.tsx` - Existing R3F patterns
- `/content-collections.ts` - Content Collections configuration

### New (to create)
- `/app/interactive/page.tsx` - Client-only entry point
- `/app/interactive/layout.tsx` - Minimal layout
- `/components/interactive/` - All 3D components
- `/lib/interactive/store.ts` - Zustand store
- `/lib/interactive/types.ts` - TypeScript types
- `/public/manifests/` - Runtime content manifests
- `/public/assets/chunks/` - GLB chunk files
- `/scripts/generate-interactive-manifests.ts` - Manifest generator

---

## Design Tokens (from globals.css)

- Background: #070A0F (bg-0), #0B1020 (bg-1)
- Surface: rgba(255,255,255,0.06), rgba(255,255,255,0.10)
- Text: rgba(255,255,255,0.92/0.72/0.52)
- Warm accent: #FFB86B
- Electric accent: #7C5CFF
- Fonts: Satoshi (UI), Newsreader (prose), Monaspace Neon (mono)

---

## Performance Targets

- FCF (First Controllable Frame): <5s on 50Mbps
- Desktop (M1 MacBook Air): 60fps at Medium tier
- Mobile (iPhone 12): 30fps at Low tier
- Memory: <500MB peak with 2 chunks loaded
- Normal site: Zero Three.js bytes in bundles

---

## Quality Tiers

| Setting | Low | Medium | High |
|---------|-----|--------|------|
| DPR | 1.0 | 1.5 | min(2.0, native) |
| Shadows | None | 1024px | 2048px |
| Post-FX | Minimal | Standard | Full |
| LOD Bias | Aggressive | Normal | Quality |

---

## Chunk State Machine

```
unloaded → preloading → loaded → active → dormant → disposed
    ↑                                         │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Door proximity (15m) → preload target room
- Room entry → activate chunk, mark previous dormant
- Memory pressure → dispose oldest dormant (keep max 2)

---

## Hook Signatures

<!-- Add every custom hook with exact return type as created -->

### useInteractiveStore()
```typescript
Returns: {
  // Chunk state
  chunkStates: Map<ChunkId, ChunkState>;
  activeChunk: ChunkId | null;

  // Quality
  qualityTier: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'auto';
  setQualityTier: (tier: QualityTier) => void;

  // Settings
  settings: InteractiveSettings;
  updateSettings: (partial: Partial<InteractiveSettings>) => void;

  // Navigation
  currentRoom: RoomId | null;
  spawnPosition: Vector3 | null;
  setCurrentRoom: (room: RoomId, spawn?: Vector3) => void;
}
```
