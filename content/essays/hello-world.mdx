# Hello World

This is the first essay on The Control Room. Welcome.

## Why Build This

I wanted a space that felt like *mine* — a place to think in public, share ideas, and connect them together. Social media platforms are rented land. Personal websites are digital homesteads.

> A personal website should be an explorable index of your mind.

## The Vision

This site is built around a few core principles:

1. **Command-first navigation** — Use `Cmd+K` to search and navigate everything
2. **Connected ideas** — Essays, notes, and books link together in a knowledge graph
3. **Dark mode only** — Because it's how I prefer to read and write

## What's Coming

More essays on governance reform, technology policy, and building better institutions. Notes from the field. A library of books that shaped my thinking.

Stay tuned.
