A few years ago, I wrote a peer reviewed academic paper about the history, formation, and governance structure of Prospera. Sadly, the journal in which I published it seems to have shuttered, meaning you can no longer find that paper online.

To remedy this, I decided to republish it here! The paper is titled "Creating the First Honduran ZEDE: Lesson in Political Economy, Institutional Design, and Governance Systems," and I co-authored the paper with Prospera founder Erick Brimen and Prospera legal genius Nick Dranias.

**[Download the full journal issue (PDF, 3.5MB)](/journal-of-special-jurisdictions-issue-ii.pdf)** — our paper is the third one, starting around page 150.

I hope you enjoy!
