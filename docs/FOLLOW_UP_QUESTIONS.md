# Follow-up Questions

- Should draft essays be completely hidden in production, or should there be an authenticated preview flow?
  - yes, they should be hidden on prod for anyone who is not me, the admin/owner of the site. no one except me can see or edit drafts until I finish
- Do you want to allow raw HTML inside notes/essays, or keep it escaped for safety?
  - sure lets allow raw HTML why not
- Should the `/powerlifting` page stay hidden and `noindex`, or eventually become a public section?
  - keep it hidden w/ no index for now
- Are tag links meant to filter the `/writing` page, or should they link somewhere else?
  - idk, go read the spec and implemtation plan to figure it out
